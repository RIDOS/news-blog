# News Blog

The News Blog Project is a RESTful web application written in Go 
that provides an API to manage and fetch news articles. 
This project includes functionality to retrieve a list of news articles 
and fetch individual articles by their ID.


## Project Structure
The project follows a modular architecture, with key components defined as packages:

- `handler`: Contains HTTP handlers for API endpoints.
- `repository`: Handles data storage and retrieval logic (not fully shown here).
- `internal`: A directory containing application-specific logic, such as the repository layer.

## Future Improvements
- Add pagination for the /news endpoint to handle large datasets.
- Implement authentication and authorization for secure access to the API.
- Extend the repository layer to support database interactions.
